# FragPipe-Analyst

FragPipe-Analyst is an easy-to-use, interactive web application developed to perform various computational analyses and to visualize quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic datasets processed using [FragPipe](https://fragpipe.nesvilab.org/) computational pipeline. It is compatible with the LFQ-MBR, spectral counts, TMT, and DIA quantification workflows in FragPipe. 

FragPipe-Analyst provides multiple useful analysis features, including differential expression (DE) analysis using [Limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html), enrichment analysis (GO/Pathways) using [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/), and multiple options for missing value imputation. It provides rich data visualization capabilities, including PCA and volcano plot, sample correlation plots, heatmaps, plots for missing value and sample coverage inspection, protein abundance plots for selected protein(s), imputation effect evaluation, and more. The user can also export results in table format for further analysis, such as DE results (FC and p-values), imputed data matrix (protein abundances after performing selected imputation method), and GO/pathway enrichment results.

## Public Servers
There are two server instances
- Production server is available at [https://fragpipe-analyst.org/](https://fragpipe-analyst.org/).
- Development server is hosted at [http://fragpipe-analyst.nesvilab.org/](http://fragpipe-analyst.nesvilab.org/). It provides the most up to date version, including bug fixes.
